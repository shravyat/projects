Machine Learning Projects

PA1 - Handwritten Digits Classiﬁcation Using Neural Networks

Build and train a Neutral Network, i.e., learn the weight parameters and evaluate its performance in classifying handwritten digits from 0 to 9. 
The steps followed are 
1. Preprocess the data (Feature Selection)
2. Train the Neural Network 
3. Predict and calculate the accuracy.  

The Neural Network we have built has one hidden layer and has regularization to control the biasvariance tradeoff, i.e., we have add a regularization term (λ) into our error function to control the magnitude of parameters in Neural Network. 

PA2 - Classiﬁcation and Regression - Linear Regression and Ridge Regression

1.Implemented Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) on  medical data set, provided in the ﬁle “diabetes.pickle” 
2.Implemented - Linear Regression i.e., ordinary least squares method to estimate regression parameters by minimizing the squared loss.
3.Implemented parameter estimation for ridge regression by minimizing the regularized squared loss.

PA3 - Classiﬁcation and Regression - Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines

1.Implemented Logistic Regression and Multi-Class Logistic Regression on the mnist data(Handwritten Digits)
2.Implemented Support Vector Machines,  discriminative classifie for the classification of Handwritten Digits.
